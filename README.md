<strong>Hi!</strong>

<br  />
<br  />

<p>I am <strong>Oliver Winhammar</strong> (<code>0larszl0</code>), a third year undergraduate student at Northumbria University, studying Artificial Intelligence.<br  />
Before continuing, let me ask you something... What is your <i>hobby?</i></p>

         SuperHotLogin is a QML project that was made for SDDM logins. The design used within it is meant to relate to old style monitors while giving a futuristic vibe to it. To date it is <strong>my most starred</strong> project and has been very successful in reddit groups: <code>r/unixporn</code> <code>r/linuxporn</code>, that value ricing on linux distributions.

         An instance where a group assignment becomes a solo mission as I became the only person out of a group of 6 to contribute to this project. This gave me the opportunity to test how far I can push my skills (learnt from making the fitness-app-with-flask repo) in the deadline given alongside 2 other assignments. The goal was to try and make a more user-friendly, and interactive experience using ChatGPT, and while the project is incomplete, I was personally <strong>proud</strong> of the outcome and even <strong>managed to score a first class for it!</strong>

<p>In my own time I've taken up several projects over the years, many incomplete but each have helped build the skills that I am still developing today.</p>
<p>I've decided to showcase some of my work not only to show you readers what I have been able to do, but also to act as a reminder to myself of the successes and failures and the overall journey I have taken thus far. I hope my work can inspire others to create something for themselves or for the benefit of others without the sacrifice of another.</p>
<p>The images and videos are included in the following projects:</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Pygame related</strong>: Pacman & my own platform-shooter I named "<i>Iron Troopers</i>"</li>
   <li><strong>Discord bot</strong> named "<i>Lumos</i>"</li>
   <li><strong>Unity Projects</strong> for 2D, 3D and Virtual Reality</li>
   <li><strong>Stock Market Entries</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Other unseen projects include: <i>Pong</i>, a virtual assistant named "<i>Edith</i>", and experiments into <i>AI music generation</i>.</p>
